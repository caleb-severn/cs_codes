All governments violating childrens rights in conflict zones must be put on the list of shame, with no exceptions. Over the past 20 years, the UN Security Council has put in place a framework to protect children in conflict zones. The secretarygeneral is required to attach a list of those responsible to his report. I have seen for myself the power of the list. The TMVP was added to the list of shame in 2006. And for many years, it was. In recent years, however, decisions about listing have become increasingly politicised, undermining the lists potential to protect children. Although SecretaryGeneral Guterres returned the Saudi coalition to his list in 2017, he removed it again in 2020, despite the UNs own findings that the coalition was responsible for at least 222 child casualties the previous year. Guterres has also removed the Myanmar armed forces, the Tatmadaw, from the list for recruiting and using children, despite hundreds of documented violations in 2019 and 2020. There is a clear mismatch between information about violations documented by the UN itself and the groups and government forces on the list."

In the basement of an old museum in a village in Albania, a 78yearold woman protects the last remnant of a dictator. Labinot and Tirana, Albania Sabire Plaku is suspicious of every stranger who sets foot in her remote village of Labinot in central Albania. For the last three decades, she has served as the guardian of the twostorey abandoned structure in the centre of Labinot, and the threemetretall 10foottall bronze statue that lies hidden in its basement a statue of Albanias first communist chief of state, Enver Hoxha. Dozens of depictions of him stood across the country during that time, but now, the one Sabire so cautiously guards is the last undamaged statue that remains. In 1943, when Albania was occupied by Italian fascists, communist partisans used mountainous Labinot as one of their war bases and, in March of that year, held the first national Communist Party conference there. There, he was chosen as the new leader of Albanias communists, which opened the way for their rein over Albania during the four decades that followed. Both historical events were held in the house Sabire now devoutly guards, a house that after the war turned into a museum to document the villages past. In 1968 during the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the uprising, the statue of the young Hoxha in military attire was erected in front of the museum. In 1991, when communist rule collapsed in Albania, the museum closed its doors and Hoxhas statue was brought down."

African countries face another debt crisis and will need more longterm help than the latest G20 debt plan offers them to ward off trouble and keep muchneeded investments coming in, according to policymakers, analysts and investors.

The United States, China and other G20 countries have offered theworlds poorest countries many of which are inAfrica relief until at least mid2021 and sketched out rules for rescheduling governmentdebtto help fend off the risk of default in the wake of the coronaviruscrisis. I worry about 2021. I worry about a deal in which many countries who will once again have to finance themselves in a slow or even recessionary economic environment where a vaccine is not yet globally available. For many countries, that is one year too many to finance themselves. Some countries will need help with theirdebtstock, not just with payments. African countries make up half of the 73 countries eligible for the G20DebtService Suspension Initiative DSSI. Much has changed since the HIPC initiative when money was mainly owed to wealthy countries and multilateral institutions."

After decades of conflict, sustainable peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan can only be achieved through civil societyled reconciliation. Sustainable peace is achieved not through meetings held in faraway capitals, but reconciliation between communities. As an Armenian and an Azerbaijani, we know that mistrust remains rife between our two nations. No political agreement on its own can convince two peoples divided by 30 years of conflict to trust each other and make peace. Armenian and Azerbaijani civil societies, however, can forge footholds upon which real peace can stand by launching initiatives that would bring the two communities together and allow them to understand each other. If what we strive for is lasting peace, this cannot be allowed to continue. Both Armenians and Azerbaijanis had their lives destroyed by this conflict, and they both have so much to gain from making peace. To do so, civil society should take steps to reconnect older Armenians and Azerbaijanis who once lived together in peace. What we should not do, however, is to attempt to convince the two communities to agree on a single version of history, for this is impossible."

I thought to myself Wow, its a nice idea. Showing my ass to the police. Mister X has played in Belarus too, but rarely, and with heavy restrictions. Because of his activism, Bancer is no stranger to the inside of Belarus jails but has previously been held for days rather than months and on minor charges, such as swearing at the police.

Last year, trials of Chinese vaccines were launched in 18 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Now, Chinese COVID19 vaccines are set to increase the countrys global market share and, according to some estimates, bring more than 10bn in sales. As China rolled out its vaccines, Indonesia, the de facto leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN, was among the first to receive the Sinovac vaccine.

However, during the past year, the number of clashes between separatist groups and security forces has declined while there has been an uptick in attacks against civilians, according to data collated by the United Nations and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data ACLED Project. Separatist groups, in particular, have intensified targeted attacks against civilians and aid workers, Njomo said. On February 13, suspected separatists killed three traditional village leaders and kidnapped 30 civilians. At least 10 government security personnel have been killed and four civilians wounded in these attacks. Fombat Forbah Dieudonne, a spokesperson for the Ambazonia Restoration Forces, a separatist group linked to the interim government, denied that any groups involved in the separatist movement have carried out abductions or killed civilians. Of those attacks, 30 were carried out by separatist groups resulting in 10 civilian deaths and 67 abductions."

No Muslims will be against the construction of a mosque at a village if it goes according to the right procedures. However, the question is why are they using Gambana There has never been any association in the village that constructed a mosque or Madrassa in Garawol using the name of an association. So why Gambana The reason why the chief and the village alkalo asked us to stop the construction of the said mosque is the fact that they term us as slaves. The construction of the mosque and the Madrassa poses no threat and its not meant to divide the village, Mansa Trawally, Gambana spokesperson said."

For centuries, forests have been central to the life of people throughout GuineaBissau. This led to a period of illegal cutting of timber that saw most of the countrys forests being targeted but sacred forests remaining largely untouched. However, a government proposal in October last year to lift the logging ban sparked concern among environmental activists, who fear this may enable a return to the timber felling that stripped the countrys forests between 2012 and 2015. The idea is to stop the cutting, so we can have an understanding of the conditions of the forest. Nelvina Barreto, a senior consultant at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the former minister of agriculture and forests, says the intention to lift the moratorium relates to a few species of trees such as rosewood Pterocarpus erinaceus, referred to as bloodwood in GuineaBissau which takes an average of 3540 years to reach its phase of maturity. Rosewood happens to be the most sought after in the international market, particularly by Chinese operators, says Barreto. However, trafficking to China the main buyer of timber from GuineaBissau has persisted over the last five years. Marina Temudo, a senior researcher at the School of Agriculture of the University of Lisbon working in GuineaBissau, notes that lifting the moratorium could further enable illegal logging of valuable timber species due to a lack of resources to oversee the new restrictions, making wood scarce for local populations who rely on it, predominantly as a domestic source of energy. At the end of the day, this belongs to the populations, says Temudo. There are already various areas of forest protected by locals who create their own reserves, but not all of these are delineated."

Southeast Asian countries would have likely experienced a much less severe drought last year if it were not for Chinas dams a new study says, prompting a pushback from the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission MRC. This, in part, was because was China holding back water upstream. The whole natural pulse of the river was missing during the wet season, said Basist, a climatologist who has done extensive research on water and meteorology since the 1990s. What was a natural flow before, is now very irregular, Basist said. A total of 11 upstream dams are now operating in China.

Fellow Te Punaha Matatini modeller Professor Michael Plank said if there was a community outbreak in Australia, the risk of importing it into New Zealand could rapidly escalate at preCovid travel volumes. As both countries were committed to stopping community transmission, she said travellers, too, had to ensure they were doing all they could to minimise risk. Otago University epidemiologist Professor Nick Wilson argued the opposite it was New Zealand that needed to beef up its border more. A recent analysis by Wilson and colleagues suggested New Zealand faced a risk of as many as nearly three border breaches each month and by some measures the country was more threatened than Australia. They looked at nine border failures in New Zealand, including the August Auckland cluster that resulted in around 180 cases and three deaths, and seven in Australia six of which led to lockdowns. When broken down by country, New Zealand had 15.5 failures per 1000 positive cases going through quarantine, compared with two per 1000 in Australia a sevenfold difference."

A source in North Korea with insight into North Korean trade activities told Daily NK last Thursday that trade companies have completed the administrative processes to receive waku approval, but the Workers Party has not yet given official instructions about the allocation of waku. If the authorities find that the companies are linked to an enemy country, they will likely not be able to receive a waku or participate in official trade in the future, the source said. Based on the sources account, the authorities are reportedly apprehensive about trade activities linked to South Korea, Japan, and the United States, as well as the import of products from these countries into North Korea. The delay in the resumption of official SinoNorth Korean trade activities may be partially related with COVID19 worries in the country."

The global economy contracted by 3.3 percent in 2020 after countries rich, poor, big and small implemented draconian restrictions and lockdowns to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Now, the IMF forecasts a better year for global economic growth mainly driven by a sizable recovery in the United States, where the IMF estimates the economy will grow 6.4 percent this year. The losses in advanced economies are expected to be smaller, at 2.3 percent. The global economy is at risk of a dangerous and permanent divergence, the US Treasury secretary warned G20 officials."

Juba, South Sudan When the pandemic struck, many feared South Sudan could be one of the hardest hit countries in Africa years of conflict had hollowed out its healthcare system and the threat of famine was on the horizon. Every time there is a crisis, the government ignores its citizens, relies on international aid, and doesnt help its own people, said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, or CEPO, a civil society group in South Sudan. But in South Sudan one of the worlds top beneficiaries of foreign aid schemes that arose after the pandemic followed a familiar pattern Donors respond to crises and aid groups are left to shoulder the countrys humanitarian needs while South Sudan spends little on its own people, according to citizens, analysts, former diplomats and aid workers who spoke to reporters. That imbalance has rankled some and sparked fresh discussions about whether there is a better way to provide aid in South Sudan even though it is unclear whether funds for the COVID19 response were misappropriated. The international community, he noted, had failed to question its role in South Sudans continuing dependence on foreign aid. Some government leaders have said such sentiments smack of colonialism. In January, the UNs emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, released a worrying report PDF detailing an overview of South Sudans bleak humanitarian situation and noting escalating violence against aid workers. The first cases of COVID19 then appeared in April 2020 and were traced to UN workers sparking a backlash against the UN and other aid groups. The same month, the World Health Organization WHO became aware of allegations that some health ministry officials were charging for COVID19 tests when they were supposed to be free, according to a WHO email received by The New Humanitarian in July and shared with Al Jazeera."

On July 6, Caribbean Community CARICOM an organisation of 15 countries in the Caribbean renewed its calls for reparations, emphasising their importance for the second stage of independence in the Caribbean. First, because the case for reparations, inspired by the works of thinkers like CLR James, Eric Williams, and Walter Rodney, is itself rooted in radical West Indian tradition that led to the agitation of African and Caribbean independence, and is indeed a continuation of that struggle. If the Caribbean right now is advancing the cause for reparations, then we need to bring that frame of thought and action back.

Strawcoloured fruit bats at Kasanka National Park Georgina SmithAl Jazeera Strawcoloured fruit bats, dubbed the gardeners of Africa, are important for the regeneration of woodland forest and Indigenous fruit trees. James Mwanza, community outreach manager at Kasanka Trust, which manages the park, says commercial agriculture is the main threat to natural resources which the bats and communities surrounding the park depend on. Churchill Musungwa is a voluntary community forest guard, as well as a farmer. After seeing the forest around his home destroyed, his community was supported by Kasanka Trust to legally own the land. We tried to mitigate that through community forests and other initiatives, he said. Around Kasanka National Park people mostly get their livelihood out of the forest. So if they protect their community forest, then it is easier for them to be stewards to their children. They can be responsible because they can have the sense of ownership towards the forest."

Zimbabwes tourism sector is estimated to have lost 1bn in potential revenue last year due to coronavirus pandemic. Once again, the Victoria Falls locally known as MosioaTunya, which means the smoke that thunders is at its peak, but only a few can witness this magnificent cascading waterfall straddling Zimbabwe and Zambia. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, more than 350,000 people each year trekked to the Zimbabwean side of the waterfall to see one of the worlds natural wonders. Now, hopes are high that a vaccine rollout could bring back muchneeded tourism in the resort town but for some holiday businesses, it might take more than just a COVID19 shot to recoup the losses in a country that has been in the throes of a severe economic crisis. President Emmerson Mnangagwa receives the COVID19 vaccine in Victoria Falls Tendai MarimaAl Jazeera Zimbabwe recorded its first coronavirus case a year ago, a resident of Victoria Falls. In a symbolic move aimed at promoting tourism recovery, Mnangagwa travelled to Victoria Falls to get his shot on Wednesday. In this town, people need to go back to work others need to reopen their businesses and even for me, as time goes on, it will become impossible to serve my clients if I dont get vaccinated, she said. Once I get back to work Ill start to meet people from all over the world so I need to take the vaccine to protect myself and my family. Vaccination is voluntary, but for some people, it is a requirement to return to work."

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center. Naypyidaw Yangon, Myanmar Since launching their February 1 military coup, Myanmars generals have largely stayed out of the limelight, secluded in the countrys ghost town capital of Naypyidaw. Until now, reporters from outside Myanmar have also been strictly kept out. During an hourlong conversation with the Globe on April 4, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun never wavered from the militarys message of righteousness in overthrowing the countrys civilian government and in using violence to consolidate power in the two months since. He refused to give an exact estimate of when the military, also known as the Tatmadaw, would allow Myanmar to return to some form of civilian rule. He walked back the initial timeline of one year, suggesting the military could extend its ongoing state of emergency order for as long as two years. Major General Zaw Min Tun speaks to the foreign press tour in Naypyidaw, Myanmar April 4, 2021 Allegra Mendelson Southeast Asia Globe Al Jazeera In an attempt to justify the power grab as well as the violence used against civilians, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the armys commanderinchief and Myanmars defacto ruler, has repeatedly cited claims of election fraud in last years November 8 elections.

North Korea has announced it will not attend the Tokyo Olympic Games because of coronavirus concerns, dashing South Korean hopes the Games could serve as a catalyst to revive stalled peace talks. The decision makes it the first time North Korea has missed a Summer Olympics since it boycotted Seoul in 1988 amid the Cold War. Those games were also much about politics. Japans Olympic Committee said North Korea has not yet notified it that it wouldnt participate in the Tokyo Games. North Korea also has hostile relations with Japan and the two countries do not have any formal diplomatic relations, although talks have been held in the past. North Korea had previously boycotted the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, although it sent a delegation in both the 1972 Winter Games in Sapporo and the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. North Koreas official KCNA news agency had previously reported the committee meeting, without mentioning the Olympic decision. Experts say sanctions relief would get North Koreas attention to return to talks as the country faces economic decline.

Southeast Asian countries would have likely experienced a much less severe drought last year if it were not for Chinas dams a new study says, prompting a pushback from the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission MRC. This, in part, was because was China holding back water upstream. The whole natural pulse of the river was missing during the wet season, said Basist, a climatologist who has done extensive research on water and meteorology since the 1990s. What was a natural flow before, is now very irregular, Basist said. A total of 11 upstream dams are now operating in China. Somkiat, who is also a member of the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission MRC, said more studies were needed to understand droughts effectively. The system of dams, she said, has disrupted downstream flows of water, sediment and vital nutrients, which in turn have had devastating impacts on the ecosystem and aquatic resources important for communities living in the Lower Mekong countries. While Basist agreed that weather conditions were the primary cause for the drought, he said the dam exacerbated the issue. It was a onetwo punch, he said."
